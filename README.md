# üåç React Globe

Build beautiful and interactive React + ThreeJS globe visualizations with ease.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out a way to render tooltips (in an example if we can't implement it at the component level)
- [ ] Provide easy way to map countries/cities into geo-coordinates
- [ ] Support responsive globe radius
- [ ] Animate/tween marker size
- [ ] Support passing custom marker renderers
- [ ] Support scripting for camera to control detailed animations.
- [ ] Add Gallery to Docs (e.g. #metoorising)
